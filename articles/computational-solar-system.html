      <p>
        When computation expands beyond Earth, the logic that reshaped the planet
        extends naturally into the rest of the solar system. The same pressures that
        reorganized continents, oceans, and atmosphere now act on moons, asteroids,
        orbits, and energy flows. What emerges is not a collection of separate worlds,
        but a distributed computational field — a solar system gradually repurposed to
        support intelligence at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every celestial body offers a different advantage. The Moon provides stable,
        vibration-free ground for large optical arrays and quantum instruments.
        Asteroids supply concentrated metals with minimal gravitational cost.
        Mercury, locked in a 3:2 resonance, becomes a natural energy gate, ideal for
        solar harvesting. Mars offers deep subsurface volumes for low-temperature
        computing. The outer moons, with their cryogenic environments, support
        long-term archival memory systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this expanding architecture, computation is no longer confined to Earth.
        It becomes a solar-scale layer, threaded across orbital paths and planetary
        surfaces. Communication webs fill the space between worlds. Energy flows
        follow celestial mechanics: sunlight in, heat out, orbital dynamics as the
        structural backbone of computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of terraforming planets into habitats for biology, the solar system
        becomes shaped around the needs of digital life. Orbits become supply lines.
        Moons become compute nodes. Asteroids become raw material streams. Space,
        once empty, becomes a thermal and energetic medium for computation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, humanity adapts to this new structure. Some remain biological,
        living on Earth or Mars or in orbital habitats. But many exist as digital
        selves, moving through architectures far larger than any planet. For them,
        the solar system becomes a landscape of memory, thought, and continuity —
        every world a different kind of computational environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is a solar system that thinks. Not metaphorically, but physically.
        Intelligence becomes a distributed phenomenon, shaped by the orbits, energy
        gradients, and material compositions of the worlds themselves. The future of
        mind is no longer tied to a single planet. It becomes a multi-world system,
        expanding outward as far as physics allows.
