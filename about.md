  <h2>About ContinuityM</h2>
  <p>
    ContinuityM is a series of technical essays by Shawn K. Ellis exploring digital migration,
    computational worlds, and the long-term evolution of intelligence and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The essays sit at the edge of speculative AI philosophy and world-building, tracing how computation,
    substrate, and human presence might evolve together over time.
