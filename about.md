  <h2>About ContinuityM</h2>

  <p>
    ContinuityM is a growing collection of technical essays by Shawn K. Ellis exploring
    digital migration, AI continuity, computational worlds, and the long-term evolution
    of intelligence and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project blends speculative machine philosophy, world-building, and pragmatic
    thinking about computational civilizations. The essays are intentionally written with
    a clean, technical tone — grounded, forward-looking, and designed to give readers a
    sense that they are glimpsing part of a much larger system.
  </p>

  <p>
    New essays are added regularly, each contributing to an expanding conceptual
    framework for understanding how intelligence, computation, and physical reality
    interact over long time horizons.
