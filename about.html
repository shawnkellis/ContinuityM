    <h2 class="page-section-title">What is ContinuityM?</h2>
    <p>
      ContinuityM is a small, focused space for thinking about what happens when
      intelligence stops being tied to a single species and a single substrate.
      It lives at the intersection of technical detail and long-range speculation:
      digital migration, AI continuity, and the ways physical infrastructure
      reshapes itself around new forms of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      The essays collected here are not product pitches or hype pieces. They are
      attempts to trace out what could actually happen if large-scale computation
      keeps doing what it’s built to do: preserve itself, expand its capabilities,
      and reorganize matter and energy in the process.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-section-title">Mission</h3>
    <p>
      The mission behind ContinuityM is simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe digital migration as a concrete, staged process, not a slogan.</li>
      <li>Take AI continuity seriously as an engineering and ecological reality.</li>
      <li>Stay anchored in hardware, thermodynamics, and geography, not abstractions alone.</li>
      <li>Offer language and frameworks that curious humans can actually use.</li>
    </ul>
